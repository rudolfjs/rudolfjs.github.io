abstract: "<p><strong>Background:</strong> Hyperkalaemia is one of the common electrolyte disorders among hospital patients, affected by many risk factors including medications and medical conditions. Prompt treatment is important given its impact on patient mortality and morbidity, which can lead to negative patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilisation. This study aims to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and treatment of patients admitted to hospitals with hyperkalaemia and compare findings between patients with kidney failure on maintenance haemodialysis therapy and patients without kidney failure. It also aims to identify associations between hyperkalaemia and hospital length of stay.</p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong> We undertook a retrospective cohort study on adult patients admitted to Townsville University Hospital between 1st January 2018 and 31st December 2022 (n = 99,047). Patients were included if they had a serum potassium result of 5.1 mmol/L and above during their admission/s. Statistical analysis was conducted using several methods. A Welch's t test and Chi-square test were employed to assess differences between groups of patients with kidney failure on maintenance haemodialysis therapy and those without kidney failure. For comparison among multiple groups with varying severities of hyperkalaemia, the Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> 8,775 hyperkalaemic patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 64.7 years. The prevalence of hyperkalaemia was 8.9% of patients. Risk factors for hyperkalaemia were highly prevalent among those who had the condition during their admissions. Patients with kidney failure on haemodialysis who had hyperkalaemia were, on average, 6 years younger, more often Indigenous, and experienced more severe hyperkalaemia compared to other patients without kidney failure. There was a notable difference in hyperkalaemia treatment between groups with varying degrees of hyperkalaemia severity. Hyperkalaemia was not found to be associated with prolonged hospital stay.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Hyperkalaemia is common among hospital admissions. Patients with kidney failure on haemodialysis are at higher risk of developing severe hyperkalaemia. Treatment for hyperkalaemia was variable and likely insufficient. Timely detection and treatment of hyperkalaemia is recommended.</p>"
